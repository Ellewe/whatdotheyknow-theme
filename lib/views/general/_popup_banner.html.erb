As you can see, we don't yet have a complete Welsh translation of WhatDoTheyKnow. Please help us get there by adding translations at <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/alaveteli/" target="_blank">Transifex</a>. You can read more about working with translations for <a href="http://www.alaveteli.org/" target="_blank">Alaveteli</a>, the software that runs WhatDoTheyKnow, <a href="https://github.com/mysociety/alaveteli/blob/develop/doc/TRANSLATE.md" target="_blank">here</a>.

  Our friends over at the <a href="http://www.cfoi.org.uk/"
  target="_blank">Campaign for Freedom of Information</a> are
  having financial troubles. Without their amazing work there
  would be no Freedom of Information Act, and no
  WhatDoTheyKnow. Please visit their site
  and <a href="http://www.cfoi.org.uk/fundraisers/help-the-campaign/"
  target="_blank">show them your support</a>.
